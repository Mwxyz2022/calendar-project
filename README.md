## [Calendar-app Netlify](https://lucent-praline-056e76.netlify.app/)

## Functionality:

The app was developed using the React library

When you click the "create" button, by default, the nearest possible time for an event with a duration of 1 hour is selected

Events are created according to the rules:

- created within one day
- duration not less than 15 min. no longer than 6 hours.
- start and end times in multiples of 15 minutes

When you click on the hour cell, the application will offer to create an event in the selected range

You cannot delete an event 15 minutes before it starts

Project commands:

- `npm start ` "Starting project"
- `npm run build` "Bundling project"
